# OR gallery

Repository with python implementation of classic optimisation and operational research algorithms.

- Branch and Bound. [Code](https://github.com/paulafernalia/or-gallery/blob/main/src/or_algorithms/branch_and_bound.py) and [example](https://github.com/paulafernalia/or-gallery/blob/main/notebooks/branch_and_bound.ipynb).
- Dijkstra algorithm - shortest path problem. [Code](https://github.com/paulafernalia/or-gallery/blob/main/src/or_algorithms/dijkstra.py) and [example](https://github.com/paulafernalia/or-gallery/blob/main/notebooks/dijkstra.ipynb).


To run locally run the following from the root directory:

```
make setup_normal
```

To use in development mode, run the following instead

```
make setup_test
```
